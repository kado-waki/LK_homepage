================================================================================

"Something you can feel."

The goal is not to inform—it's to evoke. Before a single word is read, the
visitor should feel something: warmth, nostalgia, curiosity, delight. This
website is a digital handshake, not a digital resume.


================================================================================
                              CORE PHILOSOPHY
================================================================================

FEELING OVER FUNCTION
---------------------
The first 3 seconds matter more than everything else combined. The site should
trigger an emotional response—a flicker of recognition, a smile, a "whoa."
Content supports the feeling; it doesn't lead.

NOSTALGIA AS A SUPERPOWER
-------------------------
The 2009-2010 era of UI design (Facebook's blue gradients, iTunes' Cover Flow,
early iPhone skeuomorphism) created interfaces that felt tactile and alive.
These weren't just tools—they were places you wanted to be. We're borrowing
that magic.

PLAYFUL ≠ UNSERIOUS
-------------------
Dynamic, delightful interactions signal creativity and intentionality. They
show craft. The best designers will recognize this immediately.


================================================================================
                              DESIGN LANGUAGE
================================================================================

THE OLD-SCHOOL AESTHETIC
------------------------
Draw from the visual vocabulary of 2008-2011:

• Skeuomorphism: Elements that look touchable—buttons that look like buttons,
  surfaces that look like materials (brushed metal, linen, leather grain)

• Glossy "Aqua" effects: Subtle glass-like reflections, gel buttons with
  highlights and shadows that make them look pressable

• Rich gradients: Not flat colors—depth. Blues that shift from light to dark,
  toolbars with subtle dimension

• Drop shadows: Soft, realistic shadows that lift elements off the page

• Beveled edges: That 3D "raised" look on buttons and panels

• Rounded corners: Generous, friendly radii (8-12px)

• Textures: Subtle noise, linen patterns, paper grain—surfaces that feel real

• Reflections: Elements that cast reflections below them (think Cover Flow)

COLOR PALETTE
-------------
Consider warm, slightly desaturated tones mixed with era-appropriate accents:

• Primary: A rich blue reminiscent of early Facebook (#3b5998) or iTunes
  sidebar gradients
• Secondary: Warm grays with slight texture
• Accents: Glossy greens for actions, warm oranges for highlights
• Background: Off-white or subtle linen texture—never stark white

TYPOGRAPHY
----------
• Headlines: Something with personality—consider rounded sans-serifs or
  friendly serifs that feel approachable
• Body: Clean and readable, but with character
• Consider: Slight text shadows on headers for that embossed look

MOTION & INTERACTION
--------------------
• Hover states that feel responsive: buttons that "press in," links that glow
• Smooth transitions (ease-in-out, ~200-300ms)
• Subtle parallax or floating elements
• Consider: A tasteful loading animation that sets the mood before content
  appears
• Easter eggs: Hidden interactions that reward the curious


================================================================================
                              CONTENT SECTIONS
================================================================================

1. THE LANDING / HERO
---------------------
Purpose: Immediate emotional impact

• A bold, warm greeting—not "Welcome to my website" but something with voice
• Consider: An interactive element right away (something that responds to
  cursor, a playful animation, a "widget" that does something unexpected)
• Visual anchor: Could be a stylized photo, an illustration, or an abstract
  element that feels personal
• Minimal text—let the design speak first

2. THE PROFESSIONAL GLIMPSE
---------------------------
Purpose: Quick credibility without duplicating LinkedIn/resume

• Brief "what I do" statement (1-2 sentences max)
• Prominent, styled buttons/links to:
  - LinkedIn profile
  - Resume/CV (PDF or link)
• Consider: A "currently" section ("Currently: [role] at [company]")
• Design note: These could be styled as old-school badges or buttons—tactile,
  clickable, satisfying

3. THE PERSONAL CORNER
----------------------
Purpose: Show the human behind the professional

HOBBIES & INTERESTS
• Not a bulleted list—make it visual and explorable
• Consider: A "shelf" of interests (like iTunes album view), or interactive
  cards that flip/expand
• Categories might include: Creative pursuits, learning, collections,
  obsessions, side projects

CURRENTLY CONSUMING
• "Now reading" / "Now listening" / "Now watching"
• Could be displayed as actual media—book covers, album art, show posters
• Consider: Pulling this dynamically (Spotify API, Goodreads, Letterboxd)
  or keeping it manual for curation
• Design: Stack of records, pile of books, a "media player" widget

4. THE CONTACT PORTAL
---------------------
Purpose: One-click connection

• NOT a traditional contact form with 5 fields
• A single, inviting button: "Say Hello" / "Drop a Note"
• Opens a minimal overlay or expands inline
• Just: Name (optional), Message, Send
• Consider: mailto: link that pre-fills subject line for true one-click
• Or: A simple embedded form (Formspree, Netlify Forms, etc.)
• Design: Style it like sending a physical note—paper texture, stamp, etc.


================================================================================
                        ELEMENTS THAT CATCH DESIGNERS' EYES
================================================================================

Based on what makes personal sites memorable in the design community:

CUSTOM CURSOR
-------------
A small thing that signals big intentionality. Could be themed to the overall
aesthetic (a pointer with personality, something that changes on hover).

SOUND DESIGN (Optional, Tasteful)
---------------------------------
A subtle click on button press, a soft whoosh on page transition. Must be
optional and never intrusive—but when done right, it's unforgettable.

CUSTOM 404 PAGE
---------------
A delightful dead-end shows you care about every corner of the experience.

FAVICON & BROWSER TAB
---------------------
Animated favicon, clever tab title that changes ("Come back!" when
unfocused), attention to the small details.

VIEW SOURCE EASTER EGG
----------------------
A comment in the HTML for those who peek behind the curtain. Designers check.

SCROLL EXPERIENCE
-----------------
Not aggressive parallax, but thoughtful reveal. Elements that fade in with
purpose, sections that feel like turning pages.

RESPONSIVE PERSONALITY
----------------------
The mobile experience should feel just as intentional—not a shrunk desktop,
but a reimagined experience that keeps the soul.

LOADING STATE
-------------
If any loading is required, make it delightful. A playful animation, a witty
message, something that makes waiting feel like part of the experience.

"MADE BY" FOOTER
----------------
A personal sign-off. "Crafted by LK" with a small flourish. Shows pride in
the work.


================================================================================
                              TECHNICAL NOTES
================================================================================

RECOMMENDED APPROACH
--------------------
• Static site generator (Astro, Next.js, or even vanilla HTML/CSS/JS for
  ultimate control)
• CSS: Consider mixing modern CSS with intentionally "retro" techniques
• Hosting: Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages
• Keep it fast—nostalgia shouldn't mean slow

ACCESSIBILITY
-------------
• Old-school aesthetic doesn't mean old-school accessibility
• Ensure contrast ratios are met
• Interactive elements are keyboard-navigable
• Alt text on images
• The design can feel retro while being fully modern in function


================================================================================
                              INSPIRATION TOUCHSTONES
================================================================================

• iTunes 10 (2010): Cover Flow, brushed metal, reflections
• Facebook 2009: The blue gradient header, rounded photo corners, the "Wall"
• iPhone OS 3: Glossy icons, linen textures, skeuomorphic apps
• Letterboxd: Modern example of personality-driven design with film aesthetic
• Poolside.fm: Retro aesthetic done with full commitment
• henry.codes, leerob.io, joshwcomeau.com: Modern personal sites with
  personality that designers admire


================================================================================
                              SUCCESS METRICS
================================================================================

The site succeeds if:

1. Someone screenshots it to share with a friend
2. A visitor stays longer than they "need" to
3. The feeling lingers after the tab is closed
4. It makes you smile when you visit your own site


================================================================================
                              NEXT STEPS
================================================================================

1. Mood board: Collect screenshots of 2009-2011 UI, color swatches, textures
2. Content draft: Write the actual copy in your voice
3. Wireframes: Rough layout sketches (low-fi first)
4. Prototype: Build one section to nail the feel before scaling
5. Iterate: Share with trusted friends/designers for gut-check feedback


================================================================================

"A website should feel like a place—one that's unmistakably yours."
